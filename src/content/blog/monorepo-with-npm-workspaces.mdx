npm 7 introduced the concept of workspaces to facilitate the management of
monorepos. Here we will explore how to create one, manage local and external
dependencies, and more.

There are two things to keep in mind when working with npm workspaces:

1. There’s only one `node_modules` folder located at the root of the repo.
1. The installation of npm packages should be done at the root of the repo and
   using the `--workspace` (or `-w`) argument when needed (we will see more
   about it down below).

Here’s the folder structure of the monorepo we are going to work with in this
blog post:

```text title="Folder structure"
- package.json
- packages/
	- utils/
		- package.json
	- app1/
		- package.json
	- app2/
		- package.json
```

## Create the main package.json

First of all, let’s create a folder for the monorepo and create the main
package.json

```bash title="Terminal"
mkdir monorepo
cd monorepo
npm init
```

## Create a workspace

Then, let’s create our first workspace, `utils`, which will be shared in both
apps. The `--workspace` (or `-w`) argument specifies the path to the workspace.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm init -w packages/utils
```

<Highlight>
  You can create a scoped package inside a workspace too using the `--scope`
  argument:

`npm init -w packages/utils --scope frago12`

</Highlight>

The command above does a few things:

- Creates the specified folder(s) `./packages/utils` and the `package.json` for
  that workspace.

```text title="Terminal"
- pacakge.json
- packages/
	- utils/
		- package.json
```

- Adds a reference to the `utils` workspace in the main `package.json`.

```json showLineNumbers title="monorepo/package.json"
{
  "name": "monorepo",
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/utils"
  ],
	...
}
```

- Generates a symlink of the new package (workspace) into the `node_modules`
  folder at the root of the monorepo (we can verify this by running `npm ls`).

<Highlight>
  You can also symlink the local packages (workspaces) to the `node_modules`
  folder by executing `npm install` in the root of the monorepo.

## Install external dependencies

Once we have a workspace created, we can install core dependencies (available
for all workspaces) or worskpace-specific dependencies (available only for a
specific workspace).

<Highlight>
  As mentioned above, all the dependencies **must** be installed from the root
  folder.
</Highlight>

### Core dependencies

Just `npm install` them from the root folder. It will add the dependency to the
main `package.json` file located at the root of the monorepo.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install -D prettier
```

```json showLineNumbers title="monorepo/package.json"
{
  "name": "monorepo",
	"devDependendencies": {
		"prettier": "...",
	},
  ...
}
```

### Worskpace-specific dependencies

Same as the core dependencies, but you need to specify the workspace (`-w`)
where you want to install the dependency.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install date-fns -w @frago12/utils
```

This will add the `date-fns` dependency to the `utils/package.json` file.

```json showLineNumbers title="monorepo/packages/utils/package.json"
{
  "name": "@frago12/utils",
  "dependencies": {
    "date-fns": "..."
  }
}
```

## Reference a local package

Let’s say at this point we have created a couple more workspaces,
`@frago12/app1` and `@frago12/app2`. And, we want to install the package we
previously created, `@frago12/utils` , in one of them.

A local package can be installed in the same way external packages are.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @frago12/utils -w @frago12/app1
```

The command above will add the dependency in the package.json file of the
specified workspace.

```json showLineNumbers  title="monorepo/packages/app1/package.json"
{
  "name": "@frago12/app1",
  "despendencies": {
    "@frago12/utils": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

That means we can import our local package just like any other dependency inside
the app.

```javascript showLineNumbers title="monorepo/packages/app1/src/index.js"
import { something } from "@frago12/utils"
...
```

<Highlight>
  npm will try to resolve local pacakges first. If the package is not found it
  will try to resolve them from the npm registry. Some versions of npm could
  have a buggy behavior related to this. See the [found issues](#found-issues).
</Highlight>

## Execute npm commands

One of the main advantages of having a monorepo is that you can execute npm
commands in multiple workspaces simultaneously, for example, upgrading the
version of an npm dependency in all workspaces:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install react@18 -ws
```

Or only in specific workspaces:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install react@18 -w @frago12/app1 -w @frago12/app2
```

The same strategy works for executing npm commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run build -ws --if-present
```

Notice the `—if-present` flag. It will execute the `build` command in all
workspaces where that script exists.

## Found issues

While working with npm workspaces, I found an issue with specific versions of
npm where it no longer resolves the local packages first. Fortunately, npm@8.5
fixes the problem. See
[BUG ^7.20.3 no longer resolves local package first on install (workspaces) · Issue #3637 · npm/cli · GitHub](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3637)
