We can use the Prisma ORM to access multiple database in the same project. Here
we will see how to do it.

## 1. Create a new Prisma file

Make a new folder where the `schema.prisma` file will live. It can be created
using the Prisma init command.

```bash title="Terminal"
prisma init
```

This will create the Prisma schema file inside a `prisma/` directory. You can
also make the Prisma schema manually if you want to have a different folder
structure.

**Note:** If you want to pull the state of a database to the new `schema.prisma`
file, you have to specify the path to that prisma file.

```bash title="Terminal"
prisma db pull --schema ./path/to/schema.prisma
```

## 2. Specify where the Prisma client of the second database will be generated

By default, when a Prisma client is generated, Prisma creates a `.prisma/`
folder inside the `node_modules/`. And this client is invoked by the
`@prisma/client` package.

To access the second database through Prisma, we need to generate the Prisma
client in a directory different than the default one. To do this, add an
`output` property in the `generate` section of the Prisma schema file to specify
where the Prisma client for this schema wil be generated.

```js title="~/second-db/prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
	provider = "prisma-client-js"
	output = "../../node_modules/@prisma-second-db"
}
```

## 3. Generate the Prisma client

Now we need to generate the Prisma client, make sure to specify the path to the
Prisma schema file, otherwise, Prisma will generate the client of the default
database.

```bash title="Terminal"
prisma generate --schema ./path/to/schema.prisma
```

**Note:** You can also generate and apply database migrations to the second
database.

```bash title="Terminal"
prisma migrate dev --schema ./path/to/schema.prisma
```

## 4. Import the Prisma client from the specified output folder

Finally, we can import the Prisma client directly from the folder where we
generated it. In this example, the Prisma client was generated inside the
`node_modules/`, so we can just import it from there:

```js title="app.js"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma-second-db";
```
