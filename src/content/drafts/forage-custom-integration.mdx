This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process to accept both SNAP
and Cash EBT payments using a "Custom Checkout" integration type. In broad
strokes, you need to make a few setup API requests and then redirect to Forage
Checkout for balance check and final payment capture. The guide assumes that you
have already received USDA approval to accept EBT payments. Furthermore, your
application should already be registered with Forage's OAuth flow, which allows
you to generate authentication tokens.

## 1. Create an EBT payment method

<Columns>
<div slot="left">Be sure to use the request body for EBT cards.</div>
<div slot="right">
  ```shell title="POST /payment_methods"
  curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.joinforage.app/api/payment_methods/ \
      --header 'accept: application/json' \
      --header 'content-type: application/json' \
      --data '
  {
    "type": "ebt",
    "reusable": true,
    "card": {
      "number": "1234567890123456",
    }
  }
  '
  ```
</div>
</Columns>

<Columns>
<div slot="left">
  Keep track of the ref field in the response. You will use this ref to include the EBT card in future requests, without transmitting the card number.
</div>
<div slot="right">
  ```json showLineNumbers title="Response"
  {
    "ref": "e866cc156c",
    "type": "ebt",
    "reusable": true,
    "card": {
      "last_4": "5455",
      "created": "2023-10-02T11:39:53.703996-07:00",
      "token": "tok_sandbox_xfy3yzShLFyagv477GKpm1,",
      "state": null
    },
    "balance": null,
    "customer_id": null
  }
  ```
</div>
</Columns>

## 2. Create Balance Check Session

<Columns>
  <div slot="left">
    Note that you will pass the payment method ref from step 1 in this request body. You are requesting a balance check for this card.
  </div>

  <div slot="right">
    ```shell title="POST /balance_sessions"
    curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.joinforage.app/api/balance_sessions/ \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json'
    ```
  </div>
</Columns>
